Buttons

Description
-----------

Only button elements are to be used to implement a button element, HTML elements permitted are <button>, <input type="button">, <input type="submit">, and <input type="reset">. <input type="submit"> is in most cases always the primary action and as such it inherits the primary button styling by default. In the same manner, the <input type="reset"> is likely always a secondary or tertiary button.

The width of a button is determined by the actual textual (and/or iconographic) content of a button, a button should never be informed by a parent element for its sizing.
